# README

In Align office, we are doing hot-desking, where there is no assigned desk for staff. They are allowed to sit anywhere in the office. Unfortunately, some staff needs to sit near their project team, and most of the time, they canâ€™t get to sit together.
Hot-desk app is an app to allow staff to book their desks and find where their colleagues are sitting.
